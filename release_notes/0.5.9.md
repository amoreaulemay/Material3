# Version 0.5.9 Release Notes

1. Simplified the `ListView`'s `Separator` declaration.
2. Removed the `safe-area-insets` interface from `MaterialTheme`.
   * This was not working properly, direct css `env()` variables will be used instead.
3. Added a `ListView` builder for text based `ListView`s
4. Added support for landscape mode on mobile devices.
   * The navigation bar hides on mobile in landscape mode.
   * Added a margin of `safe-area-insets-*` for the left and right sides in landscape mode for the main container and the FAB.
5. Reduced the opacity of `ListView`'s `Seperator`(s) to 0.25 in both light and dark mode for more consistency and to simplify the code base.
6. Added transition animation on `FAB` when scrolling down.
7. Reformatted the `FABIcon` interface.
   * Added a collapse function to uniformize.
```typescript
collapse(containerID: string = '', obj: Ref<boolean>) => void
```
